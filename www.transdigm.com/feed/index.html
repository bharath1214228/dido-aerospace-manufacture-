<p>The TELAIR main deck cargo handling loading system solution for the 777-300ERCF is one of the most innovative and unique cargo loading system on the market. Due to the sophisticated technology, the TELAIR cargo handling and loading system can be operated both mechanically and fully electrically powered. Additionally, switching between modes of operation is possible even after the initial configuration, offering each customer maximum flexibility for the deployment of their fleet. In addition to the cargo loading system, TELAIR will also supply the floor panels to complement the mechanical and electrical handling and loading system. Through state-of-the-art design and manufacturing methods, TELAIR is able to design and produce the floor panel structure to fit the installation requirement best. Compared to traditional manufacturing and installation methods, the Telair floor panels offer a weight-optimized and production system tailored design, with reduced time for installation and removal during operation.</p>
<p>TELAIR’S innovative and high-quality components and system solutions increase aircraft capacity, optimize system integration and save weight and costs. The robust individual components ensure a longer in-service life, which leads to a significant reduction in maintenance costs. “Telair is honored to have been selected by Kansas Modification Center and NIAR WERX for this thrilling new freighter program,” said Ralf Schönzler, President TELAIR. “TELAIR has the most flexible load configurations, coupled with outstanding product support throughout the aircraft lifecycle. The KMC 777-300ERCF freighter will complement airlines’ express and cargo networks. We look forward to our partnership with Kansas Modification Center and NIAR WERX.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Buena Park, CA</strong> &#8211; Leach International has recently announced that they are honored to have Leach high-reliability disconnect relays on board the NASA James Web Space telescope, which has now been fully deployed.  The Webb Space Telescope is the largest and most complex telescope ever launched into space.  </p>
<p>According to NASA, “Webb will fundamentally alter our understanding of the universe. It can observe the cosmos, from planets to stars to nebulae to galaxies and beyond – helping scientists uncover secrets of the distant universe as well as exoplanets closer to home. Webb can explore our own solar system’s residents with exquisite new detail and search for faint signals from the first galaxies ever made. From new forming stars to devouring black holes, Webb will reveal all this and more.” Congratulations to NASA for the successful deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope.</p>
